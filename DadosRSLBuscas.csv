These attacks are often sourced from virtual machines in the cloud, rather than from the attacker's own machine, to achieve anonymity and higher network bandwidth. Past research focused on analyzing traffic on the destination (victim's) side with predefined thresholds. These approaches have significant disadvantages. They are only passive defenses after the attack, they cannot use the outbound statistical features of attacks, and it is hard to trace back to the attacker with these approaches. In this paper, we propose a DOS attack detection system on the source side in the cloud, based on machine learning techniques. This system leverages statistical information from both the cloud server's hypervisor and the virtual machines, to prevent network packages from being sent out to the outside network. We evaluate nine machine learning algorithms and carefully compare their performance. Our experimental results show that more than 99.7% of four kinds of DOS attacks are successfully detected. Our approach does not degrade performance and can be easily extended to broader DOS attacks.",2017-06,2019-07-12 5:50:01,2019-07-12 5:50:01,,114-120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\B3GTKVSW\7910612.html,,,Classification algorithms; cloud computing; learning (artificial intelligence); machine learning; Cloud computing; Computational modeling; Computer crime; Adaptation models; cloud virtual networks; computer network security; data mining; Data mining; DDoS detection model; distributed denial-of-service attack; false detection minimization; Heuristic algorithms; legitimate user possibility reduction; minimisation; Netflow protocol; relearning; relearning pool; self-learning; self-learning method,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 IEEE Conference of Russian Young Researchers in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EIConRus),,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rejeitado,Fora do Escopo

It is expected to rise in popularity over other models in cloud computing. This is facilitated by its simplicity, accessibility and ease of use. With mobile cloud computing, resource-constrained mobile devices could capitalize on the computation/storage resources of cloud servers via communication networks. Despite the advantage of this innovative computing model, mobile devices in mobile cloud computing are open to more security risks because they often have to access cloud servers through untrusted networks from different locations. Therefore, security is a critical problem to be tackled in mobile cloud computing. One of the most important aspects of mobile cloud computing security is to establish authenticated communication sessions between mobile devices and cloud servers. In this paper, we present a novel authentication scheme, Message Digest-based Authentication (MDA). Technically, MDA strategically incorporates hashing, in addition to traditional user ID and passwords, to achieve mutual authentication. The effectiveness of MDA is validated with Scyther, a widely-used security protocol analyzer. Our experimental results indicate that MDA is capable of withstanding a variety of different security attacks, such as man-in-the-middle, replay attacks, etc.",2016-11-10,2019-07-12 5:22:45,2019-07-12 5:22:45,2019-07-12 5:22:44,18,,1,5,,J Cloud Comp,MDA,,,,,,,en,,,ScienceDirect,,Springer Link,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\X4JMJAJG\Irain et al. - 2017 - Landmark-based data location verification in the c.pdf,,,Cloud computing; Cloud storage; Data location verification; Landmark-based approaches; Security attacks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aceito,Valido

This paper presents the second phase of the research in providing a network management system capable of delivering end-to-end QoS guarantees for Internet of Things (IOT) networks. The first phase of this work used a wireless test bed to develop a propagation model to incorporate the attenuation due to foliage in dense vegetation typically found in PA environments. The output of this propagation model will influence the decision making process in the network management system. Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSN) operate under the umbrella of the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) IEEE 802.15.4 Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical (PHY) protocol to deliver multimedia applications such as voice, video and live streaming. To operate successfully these multi-media applications have high QoS requirements. To enable these QoS requirements to be fulfilled performance metrics such as throughput, end-to-end delay and limited packet loss must be guaranteed. This next phase of the work in developing the intelligent network management system presented in this paper uses an OPNET™ simulation package to implement a modified K-Means algorithm to detect the presence of multi-media traffic. Consequently a signal informs the network management system to adopt pre-configured settings via the Personal Area Network Co-ordinator (PANC). The resulting changes implement service differentiation by manipulating the MAC layer (size of the individual GTS timeslots and duty cycle) to deliver better throughput and end-to-end delay performance. OPNET™ simulation results show that the new algorithm facilitates better performance and meets QoS requirements suitable to multimedia applications. This paper focuses on the derivation and evaluation of the performance of the K-Means algorithm. The sensory nodes are power, memory and computationally restricted. These restrictions coupled with the heterogeneous structure of the wireless network make intelligent network management systems very important if the QoS requirements are to be fulfilled. Upon detection of multimedia traffic with high QoS demands usually triggered in the aftermath of an event of particular interest e.g. security threat etc., a management system must dynamically effect change of the network configuration settings to maintain such guarantees. As real-time applications require an urgent response, the dynamic change must occur during run time automatically. This research work is novel in that it combines the output from the development of the physical layer propagation model to inform a network management system to trigger service differentiation for multimedia traffic in a PA environment.",2017,2019-07-12 5:18:25,2019-07-12 5:18:25,2019-07-12 5:18:01,142:1–142:8,,,,,,,ICC '17,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,ScienceDirect,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,Android malware; Google app engine; Google cloud messaging; machine Learning; Sandbox,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rejeitado,Fora do Escopo

Despite the extensive applicability of HE, the current constructions are sometimes considered as impractical due to its inefficiency. In this paper, we propose improvements on the linear transformation in bootstrapping, a technique allowing the infinite number of operation for HE, and homomorphic discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) using batch homomorphic encryption. We observe that the multiplication of a sparse diagonal matrix and ciphertext of a vector can be done within O(1) homomorphic computations. This observation induces the faster algorithm for linear transformation in bootstrapping and homomorphic DFT. To achieve this, we use Cooley-Tukey matrix factorization and construct a new recursive factorization of the linear transformation in bootstrapping. Our method with radix r only requires O(r logr n) constant vector multiplication and O(√r logr n) rotations by consuming O(logr n) depth when the input vector size is n. The previous method used in the library, a library that implements homomorphic encryption for approximate computation, requires O(n) and O(√n), respectively. To show the performance improvement, we implement our method on top of the library. Our implementation, along with further few techniques, of these algorithms show the significant improvements compared to the previous algorithm. New homomorphic DFT with length 214 only takes about 8s which results 150 times faster than the previous method. Furthermore, the bootstrapping takes about 2 minutes for ℂ32768 plaintext space with 8-bit precision, which takes 26 hours with same bit precision using the previous method.",2019,2019-07-12 5:15:14,2019-07-12 5:15:14,,57361-57370,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\Q2ASQV4F\8458466.html; C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\TANUYV2H\Gao et al. - 2018 - A Novel Semi-Supervised Learning Approach for Netw.pdf,,,cloud computing; security of data; unsupervised learning; Data models; Intrusion detection; pattern classification; data mining; data analysis; supervised learning; artificial intelligence (AI); artificial intelligence techniques; cloud-based robotic system; clouds; control engineering computing; data safety; ensemble learning; ensemble system; fuzziness-based method; intelligent NIDS; machine learning techniques; network intrusion detection system; novel fuzziness-based; NSL-KDD data set; robotic system; robots; Robots; semi-supervised learning; Semisupervised learning; semisupervised learning approach; Supervised learning; supervised parts; Unsupervised learning; unsupervised parts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pendente,Valido

With the evolution of internet and cloud computing, a new generation of smart APT attacks has also evolved and signature based threat detection systems are proving to be futile and insufficient. One of the essential strategies in detecting APTs is to continuously monitor and analyze various features of a TCP/IP connection, such as the number of transferred packets, the total count of the bytes exchanged, the duration of the TCP/IP connections, and details of the number of packet flows. The current threat detection approaches make extensive use of machine learning algorithms that utilize statistical and behavioral knowledge of the traffic. However, the performance of these algorithms is far from satisfactory in terms of reducing false negatives and false positives simultaneously. Mostly, current algorithms focus on reducing false positives, only. This paper presents a fractal based anomaly classification mechanism, with the goal of reducing both false positives and false negatives, simultaneously. A comparison of the proposed fractal based method with a traditional Euclidean based machine learning algorithm (k-NN) shows that the proposed method significantly outperforms the traditional approach by reducing false positive and false negative rates, simultaneously, while improving the overall classification rates.",2016,2019-07-12 5:41:16,2019-07-12 5:41:16,2019-07-12 5:40:41,64–69,,,,,,,IWSPA '16,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,Springer Link,,ACM Digital Library,,"event-place: Austin, Texas, USA",,,,,machine learning; big data; analytics; ddos detection; ddos mitigation; distributed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rejeitado,Fora do Escopo

With the breadth of the cloud computing landscape there is a need being expressed from within different cloud activities to consider how it may be best segmented so that the diversity might be more easily understood by the different stakeholders. The NIST definition considers four different deployment models (Private, Public, Hybrid, Community Cloud), three different service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and a number of characteristics (five in the final published version, but 13 in previous unpublished drafts). Exploring the definition further, this study aims to answer two questions: first, how can we use the affinity that different activities have with the definition’s characteristics and second, how well does the definition describe the whole cloud ecosystem? We find that utilising a quantitative methodology shows a clustering of different cloud projects and activities that are technically aligned and therefore likely to benefit from interactions and shared learning, and that the final (short-list) definition is more robust than the draft (long-list) definition. Finally, we present a segmentation of the cloud landscape that we believe can best support a sharing of learning between projects in individual clusters.",2017-06-05,2019-07-12 5:38:04,2019-07-12 5:38:04,2019-07-12 5:38:03,10,,1,6,,J Cloud Comp,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\DZMAM49Y\Caithness et al. - 2017 - Can functional characteristics usefully define the.pdf,,,Cloud computing; Cloud ecosystem; NIST definition of cloud computing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rejeitado,Fora do Escopo

Like many other systems connected to a wider network such as internet, MCPS are also vulnerable to various forms of network attacks. For detecting such diverse forms of attack, we need smart and efficient mechanisms. Human intelligence is good enough to track such attacks but when it is a huge number of traffic it is no more a feasible process to detect them manually as it is time consuming and computationally intensive. Machine learning techniques embracing artificial intelligence are emerging as powerful tools to detect abnormalities in the network data. Supervised Neural Networks are some of the most efficient techniques to perform such classification. In this paper, we propose an evolving neural network technique that evolves based on classification, elimination and prioritization while focusing on time, space and accuracy to efficiently classify the four major types of network attack traffic found in an effectively pruned KDD dataset. We also show a leap of performance with hyper-parameter optimization which highly enhances the benefit of our proposed mechanism.

Critical NTMA applications such as the detection of network attacks and anomalies require fast mechanisms for on-line analysis of thousands of events per second, as well as efficient techniques for off-line analysis of massive historical data. The high-dimensionality of network data provided by current network monitoring systems opens the door to the massive application of machine learning approaches to improve the detection and classification of network attacks and anomalies, but this higher dimensionality comes with an extra data processing overhead. In this paper we present Big-DAMA, a big data analytics framework (BDAF) for NTMA applications. Big-DAMA is a flexible BDAF, capable to analyze and store big amounts of both structured and unstructured heterogeneous data sources, with both stream and batch processing capabilities. Big-DAMA uses off-the-shelf big data storage and processing engines to offer both stream data processing and batch processing capabilities, decomposing separate engines for stream, batch and query, following a Data Stream Warehouse (DSW) paradigm. Big-DAMA implements several algorithms for anomaly detection and network security using supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) models, using off-the-shelf ML libraries. We apply Big-DAMA to the detection of different types of network attacks and anomalies, benchmarking multiple supervised ML models. Evaluations are conducted on top of real network measurements collected at the WIDE backbone network, using the well-known MAWILab dataset for attacks labeling. Big-DAMA can speed up computations by a factor of 10 when compared to a standard Apache Spark cluster, and can be easily deployed in cloud environments, using hardware virtualization technology.",2017-09,2019-07-12 5:12:53,2019-07-12 5:18:24,,1-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\A696S94C\8324260.html,,,cloud computing; learning (artificial intelligence); machine learning; Cloud computing; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Computational modeling; pattern classification; Support vector machines; Telecommunication traffic; computer network security; data mining; Entropy; cloud-based computer networks; cyber security; cyber security data; dimensional reduction; dimensionality problem; feature selection; heuristic attack detection approach; least weighted attributes; machine-learning techniques; network systems; network traffic data; telecommunication traffic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 Intelligent Systems Conference (IntelliSys),,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pendente,Valido

With the evolution of internet and cloud computing, a new generation of smart APT attacks has also evolved and signature based threat detection systems are proving to be futile and insufficient. One of the essential strategies in detecting APTs is to continuously monitor and analyze various features of a TCP/IP connection, such as the number of transferred packets, the total count of the bytes exchanged, the duration of the TCP/IP connections, and details of the number of packet flows. The current threat detection approaches make extensive use of machine learning algorithms that utilize statistical and behavioral knowledge of the traffic. However, the performance of these algorithms is far from satisfactory in terms of reducing false negatives and false positives simultaneously. Mostly, current algorithms focus on reducing false positives, only. This paper presents a fractal based anomaly classification mechanism, with the goal of reducing both false positives and false negatives, simultaneously. A comparison of the proposed fractal based method with a traditional Euclidean based machine learning algorithm (k-NN) shows that the proposed method significantly outperforms the traditional approach by reducing false positive and false negative rates, simultaneously, while improving the overall classification rates.",2016,2019-07-12 5:18:25,2019-07-12 5:18:25,2019-07-12 5:17:49,64–69,,,,,,,IWSPA '16,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,ScienceDirect,,ACM Digital Library,,"event-place: Austin, Texas, USA",,,,,machine learning; big data; analytics; ddos detection; ddos mitigation; distributed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rejeitado,Valido

In this paper, we formally define the problem of balancing between over-privilege and under-privilege as the Privilege Error Minimization Problem (PEMP) and present a method for quantitatively scoring security policies. We design and compare three algorithms for automatically generating policies: a naive algorithm, an unsupervised learning algorithm, and a supervised learning algorithm.

In this paper, by using anomaly detection technique in conjunction with k-means clustering, we demonstrate how users can be classified into malicious and non-malicious categories based on the activities they carried out while accessing data residing over the cloud. Additionally, it is also shown that by using supervised learning algorithm like SVM, it is possible to further classify malicious users into internal and external adversaries. Our results show that based on user activities, it is possible to identify both internal threats caused by the current or ex-employees intentionally or unintentionally, and external threats carried out by adversaries unknown to an organization.

However, because of today’s cloud infrastructure virtualization, data owners cannot easily know the location where their data are stored. Even in case of the establishment of a strong Service-Level Agreement, which includes an initial guarantee regarding data location, the CSP may then move data to another location, like another country, in order to cut storage costs or for any other reasons, including backup mistakes and fraudulent use of data. Data location verification is required due to legal, privacy, and performance constraints. Recently “Where are my data located in the cloud?” has become a challenge and solutions have been proposed to verify data location, under given assumptions regarding CSP behavior. The objective of this paper is twofold: propose a comprehensive classification of the location verification approaches and discuss their vulnerabilities regarding malicious CSP attacks.

The challenging issue is how to detect when a host is overloaded to initiate live migration actions in time. In this paper, a new approach to make long-term predictions of resource demands of virtual machines for host overload detection is presented. To take into account the uncertainty of long-term predictions, a probability distribution model of the prediction error is built. Based on the probability distribution of the prediction error, a decision-theoretic approach is proposed to make live migration decision that take into account live migration overheads. Experimental results using the CloudSim simulator and PlanetLab workloads show that the proposed approach achieves better performance and higher stability compared to other approaches that do not take into account the uncertainty of long-term predictions and the live migration overhead.",2017-02-06,2019-07-12 5:38:04,2019-07-12 5:38:04,2019-07-12 5:38:03,4,,1,6,,J Cloud Comp,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\UGESCT5E\Minarolli et al. - 2017 - Tackling uncertainty in long-term predictions for .pdf,,,Cloud computing; Long-term resource prediction; Probabilistic model; Virtual machine live migration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rejeitado,Fora do Escopo

Cloud computing resources are a natural fit for processing big data streams as they allow big data application to run at a scale which is required for handling its complexities (data volume, variety and velocity). With the data no longer under users' direct control, data security in cloud computing is becoming one of the most concerns in the adoption of cloud computing resources. In order to improve data reliability and availability, storing multiple replicas along with original datasets is a common strategy for cloud service providers. Public data auditing schemes allow users to verify their outsourced data storage without having to retrieve the whole dataset. However, existing data auditing techniques suffers from efficiency and security problems. First, for dynamic datasets with multiple replicas, the communication overhead for update verifications is very large, because each update requires updating of all replicas, where verification for each update requires O(log n ) communication complexity. Second, existing schemes cannot provide public auditing and authentication of block indices at the same time. Without authentication of block indices, the server can build a valid proof based on data blocks other than the blocks client requested to verify. In order to address these problems, in this paper, we present a novel public auditing scheme named MuR-DPA. The new scheme incorporated a novel authenticated data structure (ADS) based on the Merkle hash tree (MHT), which we call MR-MHT. To support full dynamic data updates and authentication of block indices, we included rank and level values in computation of MHT nodes. In contrast to existing schemes, level values of nodes in MR-MHT are assigned in a top-down order, and all replica blocks for each data block are organized into a same replica sub-tree. Such a configuration allows efficient verification of updates for multiple replicas. Compared to existing integrity verification and public auditing schemes, theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed MuR-DPA scheme can not only incur much less communication overhead for both update verification and integrity verification of cloud datasets with multiple replicas, but also provide enhanced security against dishonest cloud service providers.",2015-09,2019-07-12 5:12:53,2019-07-12 5:18:21,,2609-2622,,9,64,,,MuR-DPA,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\Q8AXUNWR\7929737.html,,,cloud computing; learning (artificial intelligence); machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; security of data; Cloud computing; Security; anomaly detection; pattern clustering; Support vector machines; Algorithm design and analysis; data mining; SVM; cloud security; Correlation; anomalies; Clustering algorithms; data leakages; external threats; internal threats; k-means clustering; nonmalicious categories; security threats; supervised learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 31st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (WAINA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pendente,Valido

Securing these applications against attacks targeting unknown vulnerabilities is an unsolved challenge. Network anomaly detection addresses such zero-day attacks by modeling attributes of attack-free application traffic and raising alerts when new traffic deviates from this model. Content anomaly detection (CAD) is a variant of this approach that models the payloads of such traffic instead of higher level attributes. Zero-day attacks then appear as outliers to properly trained CAD sensors. In the past, CAD was unsuited to cloud environments due to the relative overhead of content inspection and the dynamic routing of content paths to geographically diverse sites. We challenge this notion and introduce new methods for efficiently aggregating content models to enable scalable CAD in dynamically-pathed environments such as the cloud. These methods eliminate the need to exchange raw content, drastically reduce network and CPU overhead, and offer varying levels of content privacy. We perform a comparative analysis of our methods using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Bloom Filter-based classifiers for operation in the cloud or other distributed settings such as wireless sensor networks. We find that content model aggregation offers statistically significant improvements over non-aggregate models with minimal overhead, and that distributed and non-distributed CAD have statistically indistinguishable performance. Thus, these methods enable the practical deployment of accurate CAD sensors in a distributed attack detection infrastructure.",2014,2019-07-12 5:18:25,2019-07-12 5:18:25,2019-07-12 5:17:44,61–71,,,,,,,AISec '14,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,ScienceDirect,,ACM Digital Library,,"event-place: Sydney, NSW, Australia",,,,,cloud computing; intelligent apis; machine learning as a service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pendente,Valido

Even the same application will have a totally different impact on the network load when it is under clusters with different sizes, for the topology of the clusters is changed. Therefore, it is meaningful to do research on how to make use of the load of network from an application under a small cluster to predict the network load under a larger cluster, which will guide the data center on its infrastructure.

These attacks are often sourced from virtual machines in the cloud, rather than from the attacker's own machine, to achieve anonymity and higher network bandwidth. Past research focused on analyzing traffic on the destination (victim's) side with predefined thresholds. These approaches have significant disadvantages. They are only passive defenses after the attack, they cannot use the outbound statistical features of attacks, and it is hard to trace back to the attacker with these approaches. In this paper, we propose a DOS attack detection system on the source side in the cloud, based on machine learning techniques. This system leverages statistical information from both the cloud server's hypervisor and the virtual machines, to prevent network packages from being sent out to the outside network. We evaluate nine machine learning algorithms and carefully compare their performance. Our experimental results show that more than 99.7% of four kinds of DOS attacks are successfully detected.

This is essential for reducing power consumption and guaranteeing QoS and SLA fulfillment, especially for those services with strict QoS requirements in terms of latency or response time, such as web servers with high traffic load, data stream processing, or real-time big data analytics. Elasticity is often implemented in cloud platforms and virtualized data-centers by means of auto-scaling mechanisms. These make automated resource provisioning decisions based on the value of specific infrastructure and/or service performance metrics. This paper presents and evaluates a novel predictive auto-scaling mechanism based on machine learning techniques for time series forecasting and queuing theory. The new mechanism aims to accurately predict the processing load of a distributed server and estimate the appropriate number of resources that must be provisioned in order to optimize the service response time and fulfill the SLA contracted by the user, while attenuating resource over-provisioning in order to reduce energy consumption and infrastructure costs.

The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has recently evolved into a technology for building smart environments. Security and privacy are considered key issues in any real-world smart environment based on the IoT model. The security vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems create security threats that affect smart environment applications. Thus, there is a crucial need for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) designed for IoT environments to mitigate IoT-related security attacks that exploit some of these security vulnerabilities. Due to the limited computing and storage capabilities of IoT devices and the specific protocols used, conventional IDSs may not be an option for IoT environments. This article presents a comprehensive survey of the latest IDSs designed for the IoT model, with a focus on the corresponding methods, features, and mechanisms. This article also provides deep insight into the IoT architecture, emerging security vulnerabilities, and their relation to the layers of the IoT architecture. This work demonstrates that despite previous studies regarding the design and implementation of IDSs for the IoT paradigm, developing efficient, reliable and robust IDSs for IoT-based smart environments is still a crucial task.

Automated cache template attacks, in particular, are very powerful as the vulnerabilities do not need to be manually identified. Such attacks can be devised using both the Prime+Probe and the Flush+Reload techniques. In this paper, we present PokerFace, a novel method to identify and mitigate such attacks. This approach allows us to identify suspicious cache accesses automatically, without prior knowledge about the system or access to hardware metrics. PokerFace consists of two components, Poker and Face. Poker executes a memory bus benchmark to measure the available bus bandwidth and derive information about cache accesses and possible side channel attacks. Our experiments with cache attacks show a reduction of up to 14% in the memory bandwidth during the attack. When an attack is detected, Poker triggers Face which performs cache obfuscation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against keypress logging attacks. We also test it against generic Prime+Probe and Flush+Reload attacks and show that it is practically useful against a variety of cache timing attacks. PokerFace incurs modest overheads (< 8%) and moreover, does not require support from the cloud provider or changes to the hypervisor.

Accumulation of anomalies of different nature, such as memory leaks and unterminated threads, may lead the system to both fail or work with suboptimal performance levels. This problem particularly affects web servers, where hosted applications are typically intended to continuously run, thus incrementing the probability, therefore the associated effects, of accumulation of anomalies. Given the unpredictability of occurrence of anomalies, continuous system monitoring would be required to detect possible system failures and/or excessive performance degradation in order to timely start some recovering procedure.

Through optimized Machine Learning models and continually measuring system features, the framework predicts the remaining time to the occurrence of some unexpected event (system failure, service level agreement violation, etc.) of a virtual machine hosting a server instance of the application.

The fundamental SLA functions are reviewed: Admission Control, Monitoring, SLA Evaluation, and SLA Enforcement - a classic autonomic control cycle. This is followed by an investigation into possible application requirements and SLA enforcement mechanisms. We then identify five basic Load Types that a dynamic SLA system must manage: Best Effort, Throttled, Load Migration, Preemption and Spare Capacity. The key to meeting application SLA requirements under changing surge conditions is to also manage the spare surge capacity. The use of this surge capacity could be managed by one of several identified load migration policies. A more detailed SLA architecture is presented that discusses specific SLA components. This is done in the context of the OpenStack since it is open source with a known architecture. Based on this SLA architecture, a research and development plan is presented wherein fundamental issues are identified that need to be resolved through research and experimentation. Based on successful outcomes, further developments are considered in the plan to produce a complete, end-to-end dynamic SLA capability. Executing on this plan will take significant resources and organization. The NSF Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing is one possible avenue for pursuing these efforts.

It can be described as a cloud-like platform having similar data, computation, storage and application services, but is fundamentally different in that it is decentralized. In addition, Fog systems are capable of processing large amounts of data locally, operate on-premise, are fully portable, and can be installed on heterogeneous hardware. These features make the Fog platform highly suitable for time and location-sensitive applications. For example, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are required to quickly process a large amount of data. This wide range of functionality driven applications intensifies many security issues regarding data, virtualization, segregation, network, malware and monitoring. This paper surveys existing literature on Fog computing applications to identify common security gaps.

This extended range of functionalities has also seen the infiltration of new security threats. The malicious parties are using highly stealthy techniques to perform the targeted operations, which are hard to detect by the conventional signature and behavior based approaches. Besides, the limited resources of mobile device are inadequate to perform the computationally extensive malware detection tasks and to sustain the device's clean status. In this paper, we propose an effective and resource rich detection system which uses certain distinguishing combinations of permissions and intents used by the apps to identify the malware apps. Different machine learning algorithms are investigated for classification of apps into benign or malware types. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever work in which both the permissions and intents have been amalgamated for malware detection using cloud computing paradigm. Effectiveness of our approach is verified by testing the real-world malware and benign apps collected from various sources.",2014-10,2019-07-19 1:37:50,2019-07-19 1:37:50,,278-280,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\VRAAXVAQ\8701238.html,,,classification; cloud computing; Cloud computing; Machine learning; Training; random forest; Computer crime; pattern classification; Support vector machines; machine learning algorithms; computer network security; Cloud Computing; Bayes methods; support vector machine; support vector machines; SVM; Weka; DDoS attack detection; Naive Bayes; Intrusion Detection System; Random Forest; random forests; DDoS; distribute denial of service attacks; Naïve Bayes; Protocols; Tor Hammer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 Amity International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AICAI),,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aceito,Fora do Escopo

With the breadth of the cloud computing landscape there is a need being expressed from within different cloud activities to consider how it may be best segmented so that the diversity might be more easily understood by the different stakeholders. The NIST definition considers four different deployment models (Private, Public, Hybrid, Community Cloud), three different service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and a number of characteristics (five in the final published version, but 13 in previous unpublished drafts). Exploring the definition further, this study aims to answer two questions: first, how can we use the affinity that different activities have with the definition’s characteristics and second, how well does the definition describe the whole cloud ecosystem? We find that utilising a quantitative methodology shows a clustering of different cloud projects and activities that are technically aligned and therefore likely to benefit from interactions and shared learning, and that the final (short-list) definition is more robust than the draft (long-list) definition. Finally, we present a segmentation of the cloud landscape that we believe can best support a sharing of learning between projects in individual clusters.",2017-06-05,2019-07-12 5:22:45,2019-07-12 5:22:45,2019-07-12 5:22:45,10,,1,6,,J Cloud Comp,,,,,,,,en,,,Springer Link,,Springer Link,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\9SA2F7VD\Elrawy et al. - 2018 - Intrusion detection systems for IoT-based smart en.pdf,,,Internet of things; Intrusion detection systems; Smart environments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pendente,Valido

For accurate data mining computer based techniques of data pre-processing offer solutions that help the data under processing to conform normal structures which in turn considerably improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.

Over the past few decades, the development of protection method based on data mining has attracted many researchers because of its effectiveness and practical significance. Most commonly these detection methods use prelearned models or models based on rules. Because of this the proposed DDoS detection methods often failure in dynamically changing cloud virtual networks. In this paper, we purposed self-learning method allows to adapt a detection model to network changes. This is minimized the false detection and reduce the possibility to mark legitimate users as malicious and vice versa. The developed method consists of two steps: collecting data about the network traffic by Netflow protocol and relearning the detection model with the new data.

In this paper, we propose an efficient solution to tackle DDoS attacks in the SDN-based cloud environment. We first introduce a new hybrid machine learning model based on support vector machine and self-organizing map algorithms to improve the traffic classification. Then, we propose an enhanced history-based IP filtering scheme ($eHIPF$ ) to improve the attack detection rate and speed. Finally, we introduce a novel mechanism that combines both the hybrid machine learning model and the $eHIPF$ scheme to make a DDoS attack defender for the SDN-based cloud environment. The testbed is implemented in an SDN-based cloud with service function chaining. Through practical experiments, the proposed DDoS attack defender is proven to outperform existing mechanisms for DDoS attack classification and detection.

Query generalization is a way to implement flexible query answering on the syntax level. In this paper we study a clustering-based fragmentation for the generalization operator Anti-Instantiation with which related information can be found in distributed data. We use a standard clustering algorithm to derive a semantic fragmentation of data in the database. The database system uses the derived fragments to support an intelligent flexible query answering mechanism that avoids overgeneralization but supports data replication in a distributed database system.

These features make the Fog platform highly suitable for time and location-sensitive applications.

The challenging issue is how to detect when a host is overloaded to initiate live migration actions in time. In this paper, a new approach to make long-term predictions of resource demands of virtual machines for host overload detection is presented. To take into account the uncertainty of long-term predictions, a probability distribution model of the prediction error is built.

Reliability and performance of configurable system depend on successful completion of communication or interactions among its configurations. Most of the time users of configurable systems very often use critical configurations than non-critical configurations. Failure of critical configurations will have severe impact on system reliability and performance. We can overcome this problem by identifying critical configurations that play a vital role, then provide a suitable fault tolerant candidate to each critical configuration. In this article we have proposed an algorithm that identifies optimal fault tolerant candidate for every critical configuration of a software system. We have also proposed two schemes to classify configurations into critical and non-critical configurations based on: 1) Frequency of configuration interactions (IFrFT), 2) Characteristics and frequency of interactions (ChIFrFT). These schemes have played very important role in achieving reliability and fault tolerance of a software system in a cost effective manner. The percentage of successful interactions of IFrFT and ChIFrFT are 25 and 40% higher than that of the NoFT scheme. In NoFT scheme none of the configurations are supported by fault tolerance candidates.

Data sources are the most valuable and vulnerable information which is aimed by attackers to steal. If data is lost, then the privacy and security of every cloud user are compromised. Even though a cloud network is secured externally, the threat of an internal attacker exists. Internal attackers compromise a vulnerable user node and get access to a system. They are connected to the cloud network internally and launch attacks pretending to be trusted users. Machine learning approaches are widely used for cloud security issues. The existing machine learning based security approaches classify a node as a misbehaving node based on short-term behavioral data. These systems do not differentiate whether a misbehaving node is a malicious node or a broken node. To address this problem, this paper proposes an Improvised Long Short-Term Memory (ILSTM) model which learns the behavior of a user and automatically trains itself and stores the behavioral data. The model can easily classify the user behavior as normal or abnormal. The proposed ILSTM not only identifies an anomaly node but also finds whether a misbehaving node is a broken node or a new user node or a compromised node using the calculated trust factor. The proposed model not only detects the attack accurately but also reduces the false alarm in the cloud network.",2018-09,2019-07-12 5:50:01,2019-07-12 5:50:01,,60-65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\79DNZ6UC\8004896.html,,,cloud computing; Machine learning algorithms; cloud file-sharing; cloud file-sharing services; company data; company IP; discrete wavelet transform; discrete wavelet transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; DWT; graph theory; graph-based unsupervised learning; graph-based unsupervised machine learning methods; Haar transforms; Haar wavelet; Haar wavelet function; insider threat detection; Learning systems; local-outlier factor; LOF; OddBall; PageRank; peer-to-peer computing; relationship graphs; security of data; Time series analysis; two-stage machine learning system; unsupervised learning; Wavelet analysis; wavelet coefficients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI),,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aceito,Valido

However, the collective anomaly detection for multidimensional streams exists lots of problems, owing to the differences between the anomaly detection in multidimensional time series and univariate time series data. For example, the temporal continuity of multidimensional time series is much weaker than univariate time series and it is unreasonable to judge the entire multidimensional data as an anomaly if a certain dimension is abnormal. In this paper, we consider the statistical features of the subsequence of streams, proposing a novel collective anomaly detection algorithm for multidimensional streams based on iForest in a cloud environment, namely iForestFS. When using different features about mobile cloud services' metrics suggested by domain knowledge, iForestFS could detect different kinds of anomalies for mobile service security. Furthermore, we implement a distributed iForestFS using spark framework in order to improve time performance and scalability. The experimental results performed on three datasets (mainly about network security) derived from the UCI repository demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect a collective anomaly of multidimensional streams in the security domain.",2019,2019-07-12 5:15:14,2019-07-12 5:15:14,,49157-49168,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\YPPLVJHC\6903245.html,,,cloud computing; Machine learning algorithms; Intrusion detection; Training; machine learning algorithms; intrusion detection; anomaly-based IDS; cloud networks; digital signatures; Educational institutions; ensemble systems; information security; intrusion detection system; security; signature-based IDS; Training data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014 IEEE World Congress on Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pendente,Valido

In this paper we explore this idea by using a camera along with an in-vehicle computer to run computer vision algorithms that continuously observe the road conditions in high-detail. Abnormalities are automatically reported via 4G LTE to a local server on the edge, which collects and stores the data, and relays updates to other vehicles inside its zone.

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors a network for precisely this purpose. IDSs fall into one of two categories: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. Whereas signature-based IDSs rely upon pre-programmed matching rules designed by security experts and are therefore limited to pre-existing attacks in their coverage, anomaly-based IDSs attempt to identify normal and abnormal traffic, generally using machine learning, and therefore hold the promise of being able to identify novel attacks. Anomaly-based IDSs can be divided into IDSs that are trained online and IDSs that are trained offline. While IDSs that are trained online allow greater flexibility, such IDSs could be trained by an adversary to allow specific attacks. This work-in-progress paper proposes a methodology for protecting against the mistraining of an IDS trained online. Two IDSs begin with identical rule sets, but one is allowed to adjust its data to include online data while the other remains static. Both systems can report anomalies, and if the online IDS attempts to let through too much that the offline IDS does not, the decision boundaries of the online IDS are adjusted as a safeguard against mistraining.

Cloud computing relies on sharing the resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, through virtualizion. Cloud network, in particular, is virtualized through multiple logical constructs and SW layers, making cloud connectivity complex to configure, debug, and visualize. In this work, we show how to detect cloud network operational issues through monitoring and analytics, using and enhancing open source network analyzer, Skydive [2]. In particular, we focus on Noisy Neighbor Effect, a situation in which a common resource is monopolized by a noisy tenant, resulting in performance degradation experienced by other tenants. Skydive is an open-source network topology and protocol analyzer, capable of discovering and visualizing cloud network topology across its multiple layers, as well as capturing network traffic at programmable granularity, injecting network traffic, and more. Typical Skydive setup consists of multiple Skydive agents installed on various network components and one or more Skydive analyzers deployed on any compute resource in the cloud. Skydive agents discover and report the information to a Skydive analyzer, that stores it over time so it can be consumed via Web UI, command line tools, and REST API, for visualization, exploration, and analytics. In our work we used Skydive to investigate and detect the Noisy Neighbor Effect in Kubernetes (k8s) network. Our setup consisted of a commercial cloud platform, IBM Cloud Private (ICP) [1], running an HTTP server and two HTTP clients constantly sending requests to the server, all 3 are containerized Python applications as shown in Figure 1. We have installed Skydive agents on all the k8s worker nodes. To achieve our goal of detecting anomalous client behavior and creating a visual indication of such anomaly in Skydive UI, we have enhanced Skydive capabilities and contributed our enhancements back to the project by extending the Python REST client library to support traffic injections, and fixing existing bugs in the Skydive system. We used those enhancements to measure Round Trip Time (RTT) between nodes in the cloud network, detect anomalies in RTT measurements and indicate them in Skydive UI, such as the green indication in Figure 1. In this work, we have made the first step towards automatic detection of Noisy Neighbor with Skydive, using simple threshold based approach, in an experimental setup. This work can be extended in a multiple ways - support more generic and realistic multi-tenant setup; employ deeper analyses, e.g. ML and DL, also on historical data; explore additional anomalous cases, beyond the Noisy Neighbor Effect.",2019,2019-07-12 5:41:16,2019-07-12 5:41:16,2019-07-12 5:41:16,189–189,,,,,,,SYSTOR '19,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,IEEE Xplore,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,data mining; data pre-processing; missing values; outliers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pendente,Valido

Securing these applications against attacks targeting unknown vulnerabilities is an unsolved challenge. Network anomaly detection addresses such zero-day attacks by modeling attributes of attack-free application traffic and raising alerts when new traffic deviates from this model. Content anomaly detection (CAD) is a variant of this approach that models the payloads of such traffic instead of higher level attributes. Zero-day attacks then appear as outliers to properly trained CAD sensors. In the past, CAD was unsuited to cloud environments due to the relative overhead of content inspection and the dynamic routing of content paths to geographically diverse sites. We challenge this notion and introduce new methods for efficiently aggregating content models to enable scalable CAD in dynamically-pathed environments such as the cloud. These methods eliminate the need to exchange raw content, drastically reduce network and CPU overhead, and offer varying levels of content privacy. We perform a comparative analysis of our methods using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Bloom Filter-based classifiers for operation in the cloud or other distributed settings such as wireless sensor networks. We find that content model aggregation offers statistically significant improvements over non-aggregate models with minimal overhead, and that distributed and non-distributed CAD have statistically indistinguishable performance. Thus, these methods enable the practical deployment of accurate CAD sensors in a distributed attack detection infrastructure.",2014,2019-07-12 5:41:16,2019-07-12 5:41:16,2019-07-12 5:40:36,61–71,,,,,,,AISec '14,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,Springer Link,,ACM Digital Library,,"event-place: Sydney, NSW, Australia",,,,,cloud computing; intelligent apis; machine learning as a service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rejeitado,Fora do Escopo

The smart devices promise to improve human life through improved safety and security through the implementation of intelligent transportation systems, optimization of power grids, and applications in human health. Devices produce a large amount of data for analytic applications running inside a cloud infrastructure. Unlike core networks, the main objective of an attack on an IoT network is to disrupt the availability of IoT data for the applications by overwhelming devices with information requests. Detection of such an attack cannot be done either in the cloud where the analytical application runs nor on the IoT device itself due to its limited computational resources. Furthermore, the standard networking paradigm does not provide an easy way to instrument and control networking nodes, for an effective mitigation of identified threats. In this paper, we propose a fog-assisted software defined networking (SDN) driven intrusion detection/prevention system (IDPS) for IoT networks.

Cloud services are characterized by such attributes as on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid and elastic resource provisioning and metered services of various qualities. Cloud networks provide data as well as multimedia and video services. Cloud computing for critical structure IT is a relative new area of potential applications. Cloud networks are classified into private cloud networks, public cloud networks and hybrid cloud networks. Anomaly detection systems are defined as a branch of intrusion detection systems that deal with identifying anomalous events with respect to normal system behavior. A novel application of a Self-Organizing-Feature Map (SOFM) of reduced/aggregate sets of ordered vector structured features that are used for detecting anomalies in the context of secure cloud environments is herein proposed. Multivalue inputs consist of reduced/aggregate ordered sets of vector and binary features. The nodes of the SOFM - after training - are indicative of local distributions of feature measurements during normal cloud operation. Anomalies are detected as outliers of the trained SOFM. Each structured vector consists of binary as well as histogram data. The aggregated Canberra distance is used to order histogram data whereas the Jaccard distance is used for multivalue binary data. The so-called Cross-Order Distance Matrix is defined for both cases. The distance depends upon the selection of a similarity/distance measure and a method for operating upon the elements of the Cross-Order Distance Matrix. Several methods of estimating the distance between two ordered sets of features are investigated in the course of this paper.",2015,2019-07-12 5:18:25,2019-07-12 5:18:25,2019-07-12 5:18:19,27:1–27:9,,,,,,,EANN '15,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,ScienceDirect,,ACM Digital Library,,"event-place: Macau, China",,,,,Cloud Introspection Technology; Cloud Probe; Cloud Security; Introspection Cloud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pendente,Valido

These resources are supervised by different management organizations and provided over Internet using known networking protocols, standards and formats. The underlying technologies and legacy protocols contain bugs and vulnerabilities that can open doors for intrusion by the attackers. Attacks as DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) are ones of the most frequent that inflict serious damage and affect the cloud performance. In a DDoS attack, the attacker usually uses innocent compromised computers (called zombies) by taking advantages of known or unknown bugs and vulnerabilities to send a large number of packets from these already-captured zombies to a server. This may occupy a major portion of network bandwidth of the victim cloud infrastructures or consume much of the servers time.

At the same time, the cybersecurity industry is rapidly adopting Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to improve detection and mitigation of complex attacks. Traditional intrusion detection systems perform signature-based detection, based on well-known malicious traffic patterns that signify potential attacks. The main drawback of this method is that attack patterns need to be known in advance and signatures must be preconfigured. Hence, typical systems fail to detect a zero-day attack or an attack with unknown signature. This work considers the use of machine learning for advanced anomaly detection, and specifically deploys the Apache Spot ML framework on an SDN/NFV-enabled testbed running cybersecurity services as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). VNFs are used to capture traffic for ingestion by the ML algorithm and apply mitigation measures in case of a detected anomaly. Apache Spot utilises Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify anomalous traffic patterns in Netflow, DNS and proxy data.

In this paper, we formally define the problem of balancing between over-privilege and under-privilege as the Privilege Error Minimization Problem (PEMP) and present a method for quantitatively scoring security policies.

To increase the detection accuracy for malicious webpages, two methods of filling missing values are presented to process the null attribute values of webpages.

PMU data are used in real-time to inform wide area state estimation, monitor area control error, and event detection. As PMU data becomes more reliable, these devices are finding roles within control systems such as demand response programs and early fault detection systems. As with other cyber physical systems, maintaining data integrity and security are significant challenges for power system operators. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of multiple machine learning techniques for detecting malicious data injection within PMU data streams. The two datasets used in this study are from the Bonneville Power Administration's PMU network and an inter-university PMU network among three universities, located in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. These datasets contain data from both the transmission level and the distribution level. Our results show that both SVM and ANN are generally effective in detecting spoofed data, and TensorFlow, the newly released tool, demonstrates potential for distributing the training workload and achieving higher performance.

These images can be used in court as evidence of criminal cases. However, digital images are easily manipulated which brings up the need of a method to verify the authenticity of the image. One of the methods is by identifying the source camera. In spite of that, it takes a large amount of time to be completed by using traditional desktop computers. To tackle the problem, we aim to increase the performance of the process by implementing it in a distributed computing environment. We evaluate the camera identification process using conditional probability features and Apache Hadoop. The evaluation process used 6000 images from six different mobile phones of the different models and classified them using Apache Mahout, a scalable machine learning tool which runs on Hadoop. We ran the source camera identification process in a cluster of up to 19 computing nodes. The experimental results demonstrate exponential decrease in processing times and slight decrease in accuracies as the processes are distributed across the cluster. Our prediction accuracies are recorded between 85 to 95% across varying number of mappers.",2017-08-15,2019-07-12 5:23:06,2019-07-12 5:23:06,2019-07-12 5:23:05,18,,1,6,,J Cloud Comp,Source camera identification,,,,,,,en,,,Springer Link,,Springer Link,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\TD25VFLR\Talia - 2019 - A view of programming scalable data analysis from.pdf,,,Cloud computing; Data mining; Big data analysis; Exascale computing; Parallel programming; Scalability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pendente,Valido

Generally, when a mobile device (MD) discovers a cloudlet in the vicinity, it takes time to set up a VM inside the cloudlet before data offloading from the MD to the VM starts. The time between the discovery of the cloudlet and actual offloading of data is considered as the service initiation time. When multiple cloudlets are present in a nearby geographical location, initiating a service with each cloudlet may be frustrating for cloudlet users that moving from one location to another. In order to eliminate the delay caused by the service initiation time after moving away from the source cloudlet, this paper proposes a seamless live VM migration between neighbouring cloudlets. A seamless live VM migration is achieved with the prior knowledge of the migrating VM IP address in the destination cloudlet and more importantly with multipath TCP (MPTCP). We have performed a number of experiments to validate the proposed approach using Linux KVM hypervisor. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach and also show performance improvement. Specifically, there is almost zero downtime at the destination cloudlet after the migration is completed.",2016-09-06,2019-07-12 5:23:06,2019-07-12 5:23:06,2019-07-12 5:23:05,12,,1,5,,J Cloud Comp,,,,,,,,en,,,Springer Link,,Springer Link,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\54GIE4LG\Faiz et al. - 2017 - Source camera identification a distributed comput.pdf,,,Distributed computing; Hadoop; Mahout; Source camera identification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aceito,Fora do Escopo

However, the collective anomaly detection for multidimensional streams exists lots of problems, owing to the differences between the anomaly detection in multidimensional time series and univariate time series data. For example, the temporal continuity of multidimensional time series is much weaker than univariate time series and it is unreasonable to judge the entire multidimensional data as an anomaly if a certain dimension is abnormal. In this paper, we consider the statistical features of the subsequence of streams, proposing a novel collective anomaly detection algorithm for multidimensional streams based on iForest in a cloud environment, namely iForestFS. When using different features about mobile cloud services' metrics suggested by domain knowledge, iForestFS could detect different kinds of anomalies for mobile service security. Furthermore, we implement a distributed iForestFS using spark framework in order to improve time performance and scalability. The experimental results performed on three datasets (mainly about network security) derived from the UCI repository demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect a collective anomaly of multidimensional streams in the security domain.",2019,2019-07-12 5:12:53,2019-07-12 5:18:23,,49157-49168,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\JGWTQDDF\7340027.html; C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\8E4FFX27\Sanzo et al. - 2015 - Machine Learning for Achieving Self- Properties a.pdf,,,cloud computing; learning (artificial intelligence); machine learning; Cloud computing; Machine Learning; Monitoring; system monitoring; virtual machines; Cloud Computing; Servers; anomaly occurrence pattern; client-server application; client-server systems; cloud application; Computer crashes; contracts; file servers; Predictive models; Rejuvenation; service level agreement violation; Software Aging; software anomaly; system failure; System performance; system recovery; virtual machine; Web server,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015 IEEE Fourth Symposium on Network Cloud Computing and Applications (NCCA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rejeitado,Fora do Escopo

However, because of today’s cloud infrastructure virtualization, data owners cannot easily know the location where their data are stored. Even in case of the establishment of a strong Service-Level Agreement, which includes an initial guarantee regarding data location, the CSP may then move data to another location, like another country, in order to cut storage costs or for any other reasons, including backup mistakes and fraudulent use of data. Data location verification is required due to legal, privacy, and performance constraints. Recently “Where are my data located in the cloud?” has become a challenge and solutions have been proposed to verify data location, under given assumptions regarding CSP behavior. The objective of this paper is twofold: propose a comprehensive classification of the location verification approaches and discuss their vulnerabilities regarding malicious CSP attacks.

Our results identify that the sensors and fog devices are the components that have the most significant impact on the availability of the e-health monitoring system, as a whole, in the scenarios analyzed.

The drivers include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized healthcare, to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs. Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system. The system is described in detail including the algorithmic implementation of the three components and four layers.

One of such issue is outlier detection. In outlier detection, data obtained by some of the nodes whose behavior is different from the data of other nodes are spotted in the group of data.

The intermediary cloud provider is controlled by a broker that uses techniques to dynamically control the number of resources used by the client enterprise. The research presents a hybrid auto-scaling technique based on a combination of a reactive approach and a proactive approach to scale resources based on user demand. The primary goal of this auto-scaling technique is to achieve a profit for the intermediary enterprise while maintaining a desired grade of service for the client enterprise. The second goal of the technique is to reduce costs for the single client enterprise. The technique supports both on-demand requests and requests with service level agreements (SLAs).

Electroencephalograms (EEG) help in capturing brain's electrical activity and provide aid to the clinicians for detecting and predicting seizures. EEG is quite complex and predicting seizures by visual inspection is quite challenging, time consuming and sometimes much expensive as every time a trained specialists is required for inspection. Due to these issues various expert and automated seizure detection systems have been developed for accurate and fast detection of seizures. Preliminary seizure detection and prediction algorithms were patient-specific, where the classifier's training and testing were done on the same person. The current work provides a study of generalized automated seizure detection system which can classify seizures and non-seizures signals. EEG data from CHB-MIT database is considered for analyzing and validating the proposed detection system. The signals are decomposed using wavelet decomposition tree and wavelet-coefficients are used to calculate different non-linear features viz. approximate and sample entropy, energy, standard deviation. These features are classified by different supervised machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Linear Discriminant Classifier (LDC). The classifiers performance is compared using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy. The PNN classifier provided reasonably good results as compared to the other classifiers.

At the same time, the cybersecurity industry is rapidly adopting Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to improve detection and mitigation of complex attacks. Traditional intrusion detection systems perform signature-based detection, based on well-known malicious traffic patterns that signify potential attacks. The main drawback of this method is that attack patterns need to be known in advance and signatures must be preconfigured. Hence, typical systems fail to detect a zero-day attack or an attack with unknown signature. This work considers the use of machine learning for advanced anomaly detection, and specifically deploys the Apache Spot ML framework on an SDN/NFV-enabled testbed running cybersecurity services as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). VNFs are used to capture traffic for ingestion by the ML algorithm and apply mitigation measures in case of a detected anomaly. Apache Spot utilises Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify anomalous traffic patterns in Netflow, DNS and proxy data. The overall performance of Apache Spot is evaluated by deploying Denial of Service (Slowloris, BoNeSi) and a Data Exfiltration attack (iodine).",2018,2019-07-12 5:18:25,2019-07-12 5:18:25,2019-07-12 5:17:39,52:1–52:10,,,,,,,ARES 2018,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,ScienceDirect,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\BDLE9F5L\8701685.html; C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\442E4L5S\Han et al. - 2019 - Improved Homomorphic Discrete Fourier Transforms a.pdf,,,cloud computing; learning (artificial intelligence); machine learning; computer network security; Indexes; Approximation algorithms; batch homomorphic encryption; ciphertext; computer bootstrapping; Cooley-Tukey matrix factorization; Cryptography; data privacy; discrete Fourier transforms; Discrete Fourier transforms; encryption; Encryption; FHE bootstrapping; homomorphic DFT; homomorphic discrete Fourier transforms; Libraries; linear transformation; matrix decomposition; out-sourcing computation; privacy-preserving data processing; public key; public key cryptography; sparse diagonal matrix; Sparse matrices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pendente,Valido

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks threaten the ability of the cloud to respond to clients requests, which results in considerable economic losses. The existing detection approaches are still not mature enough to satisfy a cloud-based detection systems requirements since they overlook the changing/dynamic environment, that characterises the cloud as a result of its inherent characteristics. Indeed, the patterns extracted and used by the existing detection models to identify attacks, are limited to the current VMs infrastructure but do not necessarily hold after performing new adjustments according to the pay-as-you-go business model. Therefore, the accuracy of detection will be negatively affected. Motivated by this fact, we present a new approach for detecting DoS attacks in a virtualized cloud under changing environment. The proposed model enables monitoring and quantifying the effect of resources adjustments on the collected data. This helps filter out the effect of adjustments from the collected data and thus enhance the detection accuracy in dynamic environments. Our solution correlates as well VMs application metrics with the actual resources load, which enables the hypervisor to distinguish between benignant high load and DoS attacks. It helps also the hypervisor identify the compromised VMs that try to needlessly consume more resources.

The cloud security issues have been paid more and more attention by academics and industry. At present, the cloud security solutions are mainly implemented in the user cloud platform, such as the internal part of guest virtual machine, high privileged domain, and virtual machine monitor (VMM) or hardware layer. Through the monitoring of the tenant virtual machine to find out malicious attacks and abnormal state, which ensures the security of user cloud to a certain extent. However, this kind of method has the following shortcomings: firstly, it will increase the cloud platform overhead and interfere with the normal cloud services. Secondly, it could only obtain a limited type of security state information, so the function is single and difficult to expand. Thirdly, there will cause false information if the user cloud platform has been compromised, which will affect the effectiveness of cloud security monitoring. This paper proposes a cloud security model based on cloud introspection technology. In the user cloud platform, we deploy cloud probes to obtain the user cloud state information, such as system memory, network communication and disk storage, etc. Then we synchronize the cloud state information to the introspection cloud, which is deployed independent.

Applications and services previously running on private data centers are now being migrated to private or public clouds. Since most of the ASPs and enterprises have globally distributed user bases, their services need to be distributed across multiple clouds, spread across the globe which can achieve better performance in terms of latency, scalability and load balancing. The shift has eventually led the research community to study multi-cloud environments. However, the widespread acceptance of such environments has been hampered by major security concerns. Firewalls and traditional rule-based security protection techniques are not sufficient to protect user-data in multi-cloud scenarios. Recently, advances in machine learning techniques have attracted the attention of the research community to build intrusion detection systems (IDS) that can detect anomalies in the network traffic. Most of the research works, however, do not differentiate among different types of attacks. This is, in fact, necessary for appropriate countermeasures and defense against attacks. In this paper, we investigate both detecting and categorizing anomalies rather than just detecting, which is a common trend in the contemporary research works. We have used a popular publicly available dataset to build and test learning models for both detection and categorization of different attacks. To be precise, we have used two supervised machine learning techniques, namely linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF). We show that even if detection is perfect, categorization can be less accurate due to similarities between attacks. Our results demonstrate more than 99% detection accuracy and categorization accuracy of 93.6%, with the inability to categorize some attacks. Further, we argue that such categorization can be applied to multi-cloud environments using the same machine learning techniques.",2017-06,2019-07-12 5:50:01,2019-07-12 5:50:01,,97-103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\7Z9SFW2A\8530912.html,,,cloud computing; invasive software; learning (artificial intelligence); machine learning; Malware; Cloud computing; Machine Learning; virtualized infrastructures; application logs; Cloud; cloud based environments; cloud based infrastructures; cloud environments; feature extraction; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; intrusion detection systems; IP networks; Machine learning; ML; security mechanisms; system monitoring; Training; virtual machines; virtualisation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2018 International CET Conference on Control, Communication, and Computing (IC4)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rejeitado,Fora do Escopo

However, cloud computing is vulnerable to many security threats, including data leakages, compromised credentials, presence of unauthorized users or entities, execution of insecure applications or programming interfaces and APIs, shared technology vulnerabilities, account hacking, malicious insiders, and denial of service (DoS) attacks. In this paper, by using anomaly detection technique in conjunction with k-means clustering, we demonstrate how users can be classified into malicious and non-malicious categories based on the activities they carried out while accessing data residing over the cloud. Additionally, it is also shown that by using supervised learning algorithm like SVM, it is possible to further classify malicious users into internal and external adversaries. Our results show that based on user activities, it is possible to identify both internal threats caused by the current or ex-employees intentionally or unintentionally, and external threats carried out by adversaries unknown to an organization.

Automated cache template attacks, in particular, are very powerful as the vulnerabilities do not need to be manually identified. Such attacks can be devised using both the Prime+Probe and the Flush+Reload techniques. In this paper, we present PokerFace, a novel method to identify and mitigate such attacks. This approach allows us to identify suspicious cache accesses automatically, without prior knowledge about the system or access to hardware metrics. PokerFace consists of two components, Poker and Face. Poker executes a memory bus benchmark to measure the available bus bandwidth and derive information about cache accesses and possible side channel attacks. Our experiments with cache attacks show a reduction of up to 14% in the memory bandwidth during the attack. When an attack is detected, Poker triggers Face which performs cache obfuscation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against keypress logging attacks. We also test it against generic Prime+Probe and Flush+Reload attacks and show that it is practically useful against a variety of cache timing attacks. PokerFace incurs modest overheads (< 8%) and moreover, does not require support from the cloud provider or changes to the hypervisor.

Then, extraction of attack features is performed through graph-based event correlation and MapReduce parser based identification of potential attack paths. Next, determination of attack presence is performed through two-step machine learning, namely logistic regression is applied to calculate attack's conditional probabilities with respect to the attributes, and belief propagation is applied to calculate the belief in existence of an attack based on them.

With the breadth of the cloud computing landscape there is a need being expressed from within different cloud activities to consider how it may be best segmented so that the diversity might be more easily understood by the different stakeholders. The NIST definition considers four different deployment models (Private, Public, Hybrid, Community Cloud), three different service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and a number of characteristics (five in the final published version, but 13 in previous unpublished drafts). Exploring the definition further, this study aims to answer two questions: first, how can we use the affinity that different activities have with the definition’s characteristics and second, how well does the definition describe the whole cloud ecosystem? We find that utilising a quantitative methodology shows a clustering of different cloud projects and activities that are technically aligned and therefore likely to benefit from interactions and shared learning, and that the final (short-list) definition is more robust than the draft (long-list) definition.

However, cloud security is a grand obstacle for full deployment and utilization of cloud services. In this paper, we address the security of the DNS protocol that is widely used to translate the cloud domain names to correct IP addresses. The DNS protocol is prone to attacks like cache poisoning attacks and DNS hijacking attacks that can lead to compromising user's cloud accounts and stored information. We present an anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the DNS protocol (DNS-IDS) that models the normal operations of the DNS protocol and accurately detects any abnormal behavior or exploitation of the protocol. The DNS-IDS system operates in two phases, the training phase and the operational phase. In the training phase, we model the normal behavior of the DNS protocol as a finite state machine and we derive the normal temporal statistics of how normal DNS traffic transition within that state machine and store them in a database. To bound the normal event space, we also apply few known DNS attacks (e.g. Cache poisoning) and store the temporal statistics of the abnormal DNS traffic transition in a separate database. Then we develop an anomaly metric for the DNS protocol that is a function of the temporal statistics for both the normal and abnormal transitions of the DNS by applying classification algorithms like the Bagging algorithm. During the operational phase, the anomaly metric is used to detect DNS attacks (both known and novel attacks). We have evaluated our approach against a wide range of DNS attacks (DNS hijacking, Kaminsky attack, amplification attack, Birthday attack, DNS Rebinding attack). Our results show attack detection rate of 97% with very low false positive alarm rate (0.01397%), and round 3% false negatives.",2015-09,2019-07-19 1:37:50,2019-07-19 1:37:50,,296-301,,,,,,DNS-IDS,,,,,,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\ULE9684M\7813926.html,,,cloud computing; learning (artificial intelligence); machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; security of data; Cloud computing; Machine Learning; Cloud; Intrusion detection; IDS; Servers; Virtual machining; cloud environment; cloud security; intrusion detection system; Intrusion Detection System; Computer architecture; denial of service; detection efficiency; detection speed; malware code injection; parallelization; Parallelization; password cracking; scanning; security framework; virus; worm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2016 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rejeitado,Valido

With mobile cloud computing, resource-constrained mobile devices could capitalize on the computation/storage resources of cloud servers via communication networks. Despite the advantage of this innovative computing model, mobile devices in mobile cloud computing are open to more security risks because they often have to access cloud servers through untrusted networks from different locations. Therefore, security is a critical problem to be tackled in mobile cloud computing. One of the most important aspects of mobile cloud computing security is to establish authenticated communication sessions between mobile devices and cloud servers. In this paper, we present a novel authentication scheme, Message Digest-based Authentication (MDA). Technically, MDA strategically incorporates hashing, in addition to traditional user ID and passwords, to achieve mutual authentication.

We propose a prediction technique that combines a workload pattern mining approach with a traditional collaborative filtering solution to meet the accuracy and efficiency requirements. Service workload patterns abstract common infrastructure workloads from monitoring logs and act as a part of a first-stage high-performant configuration mechanism before more complex traditional methods are considered. This enhances current reactive rule-based scalability approaches and basic prediction techniques by a hybrid prediction solution.

Cloud computing relies on sharing the resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, through virtualizion. Cloud network, in particular, is virtualized through multiple logical constructs and SW layers, making cloud connectivity complex to configure, debug, and visualize. In this work, we show how to detect cloud network operational issues through monitoring and analytics, using and enhancing open source network analyzer, Skydive [2]. In particular, we focus on Noisy Neighbor Effect, a situation in which a common resource is monopolized by a noisy tenant, resulting in performance degradation experienced by other tenants. Skydive is an open-source network topology and protocol analyzer, capable of discovering and visualizing cloud network topology across its multiple layers, as well as capturing network traffic at programmable granularity, injecting network traffic, and more. Typical Skydive setup consists of multiple Skydive agents installed on various network components and one or more Skydive analyzers deployed on any compute resource in the cloud. Skydive agents discover and report the information to a Skydive analyzer, that stores it over time so it can be consumed via Web UI, command line tools, and REST API, for visualization, exploration, and analytics. In our work we used Skydive to investigate and detect the Noisy Neighbor Effect in Kubernetes (k8s) network. Our setup consisted of a commercial cloud platform, IBM Cloud Private (ICP) [1], running an HTTP server and two HTTP clients constantly sending requests to the server, all 3 are containerized Python applications as shown in Figure 1. We have installed Skydive agents on all the k8s worker nodes. To achieve our goal of detecting anomalous client behavior and creating a visual indication of such anomaly in Skydive UI, we have enhanced Skydive capabilities and contributed our enhancements back to the project by extending the Python REST client library to support traffic injections, and fixing existing bugs in the Skydive system. We used those enhancements to measure Round Trip Time (RTT) between nodes in the cloud network, detect anomalies in RTT measurements and indicate them in Skydive UI, such as the green indication in Figure 1. In this work, we have made the first step towards automatic detection of Noisy Neighbor with Skydive, using simple threshold based approach, in an experimental setup. This work can be extended in a multiple ways - support more generic and realistic multi-tenant setup; employ deeper analyses, e.g. ML and DL, also on historical data; explore additional anomalous cases, beyond the Noisy Neighbor Effect.",2019,2019-07-12 5:18:25,2019-07-12 5:18:25,2019-07-12 5:18:24,189–189,,,,,,,SYSTOR '19,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,ScienceDirect,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,data mining; data pre-processing; missing values; outliers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rejeitado,Fora do Escopo

6ZBGYGIR,journalArticle,2018,A Global Manufacturing Big Data Ecosystem for Fault Detection in Predictive Maintenance,A Novel Semi-Supervised Learning Approach for Network Intrusion Detection on Cloud-Based Robotic System,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2868171,,"Although the cloud-based robotic system has provided the services in various industries, its data safety is continuously threatened, and the network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is considered as a necessary component to ensure its security. In recent years, many machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied for building a more intelligent NIDS. Most NIDSs based on the ML method and artificial intelligence techniques are either supervised or unsupervised. However, the supervised learning for NIDS depends much on the labeled data. This weakness makes it harder to detect the latest attack patterns. Meanwhile, the unsupervised learning for NIDS often fails to give the satisfactory results. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel fuzziness-based semi-supervised learning approach via ensemble learning for network intrusion detection on the cloud-based robotic system, which can address the above issues. First, due to the good generalization ability of ensemble learning, we construct an ensemble system trained by the labeled data. Moreover, for better utilizing the unlabeled data, a fuzziness-based method is adopted for data analysis. In this way, the noisy and redundant examples in the data set are removed. Finally, we use the same ensemble approach to combine both supervised and unsupervised parts. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of the NIDS, the proposed approach is tested on the NSL-KDD data set, which is a commonly used traffic data set. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves the accuracy 84.54% and 71.29% on the, respectively, “KDDTest+”and “KDDTest-21”data sets. When compared with the stateof-the-art method, the proposed method also delivers a promising result.",2018,2019-07-12 5:15:14,2019-07-12 5:15:14,,50927-50938,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\4M2X2ZWN\8533338.html; C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\HMZULZQU\Atat et al. - 2018 - Big Data Meet Cyber-Physical Systems A Panoramic .pdf,,,cloud computing; machine learning; security of data; Cloud computing; Security; big data; Big Data; data mining; Internet of Things (IoT); intelligent transportation systems; clustering; communication technology sector; context-awareness; CPS aspects; CPS big data access; CPS big data analytics; CPS big data storage; CPS taxonomy; cyber-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); cybersecurity; data analytics; data collection; data traffic; energy; environmental monitoring; green; Green products; mobile-health systems; panoramic summary; panoramic survey; raw sensed data; real-time analytics; Sensors; social computing; space-time analytics; sustainability; Tools; unprecedented growth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rejeitado,Fora do Escopo

Traditional monitoring solutions observe the system and generate alarms when the collected metrics exceed predefined thresholds. The fixed thresholds rely on expert knowledge and can lead to numerous false alarms, while abnormal behavior that spans over multiple metrics, components, or system layers, may not be detected. We propose to use an unsupervised online clustering algorithm to create a model of the normal behavior of each monitored component with minimal human interaction and no impact on the monitored system. When an anomaly is detected, a human administrator or automatic remediation system can subsequently revert the component into a normal state.

,conferencePaper,2014,,Preventing the Mistraining of Anomaly-Based IDSs through Ensemble Systems,2014 IEEE World Congress on Services,,,10.1109/SERVICES.2014.21,,"The security of cloud networks is heavily contingent upon their ability to detect incoming attacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors a network for precisely this purpose. IDSs fall into one of two categories: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. Whereas signature-based IDSs rely upon pre-programmed matching rules designed by security experts and are therefore limited to pre-existing attacks in their coverage, anomaly-based IDSs attempt to identify normal and abnormal traffic, generally using machine learning, and therefore hold the promise of being able to identify novel attacks. Anomaly-based IDSs can be divided into IDSs that are trained online and IDSs that are trained offline. While IDSs that are trained online allow greater flexibility, such IDSs could be trained by an adversary to allow specific attacks. This work-in-progress paper proposes a methodology for protecting against the mistraining of an IDS trained online. Two IDSs begin with identical rule sets, but one is allowed to adjust its data to include online data while the other remains static. Both systems can report anomalies, and if the online IDS attempts to let through too much that the offline IDS does not, the decision boundaries of the online IDS are adjusted as a safeguard against mistraining. An experiment for testing the approach is proposed.",2014-06,2019-07-19 1:37:50,2019-07-19 1:37:50,,66-68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\VHHJN845\6903245.html,,,cloud computing; Machine learning algorithms; Intrusion detection; Training; machine learning algorithms; intrusion detection; anomaly-based IDS; cloud networks; digital signatures; Educational institutions; ensemble systems; information security; intrusion detection system; security; signature-based IDS; Training data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014 IEEE World Congress on Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Malware attacks such as virus, worm and rootkits etc. are some threats to virtual machines (VMs) in cloud environment. In this paper, we present a system call analysis approach to detect malware attacks which maliciously affect the legitimate programs running in Virtual Machines (VMs) and modify their behavior. Our approach is named as 'Malicious System Call Sequence Detection (MSCSD)' which is based on analysis of short sequence of system calls (n-grams). MSCSD employs an efficient feature representation method for system call patterns to improve the accuracy of attack detection and reduce the cost of storage with reduced false positives. MSCSD applies Machine Learning (Decision Tree C 4.5) over the collected n-gram patterns for learning the behavior of monitored programs and detecting malicious system call patterns in future. We have analyzed the performance of some other classifiers and compared our work with the existing work for securing virtual machine in cloud. A prototype implementation of the approach is carried out over UNM dataset and results seem to be promising.",2016-12,2019-07-19 1:37:50,2019-07-19 1:37:50,,991-998,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\mathe\Zotero\storage\KLJU5GPD\7828482.html,,,cloud computing; invasive software; learning (artificial intelligence); machine learning; Malware; Cloud computing; Machine Learning; Monitoring; Security; Virtual machine monitors; virtual machines; Virtual machining; decision trees; cloud environment; Databases; Cloud Security; Intrusion Detection; Anomaly Detection; decision tree C 4.5; malicious system call sequence detection; malware attacks; MSCSD; n-gram patterns; pattern recognition; program diagnostics; program-behavior analysis; System call Analysis; systems call analysis; virtual machine security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
